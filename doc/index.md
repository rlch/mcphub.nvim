# What is MCP HUB?

MCPHub.nvim is a MCP client for neovim that seamlessly integrates [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers into your editing workflow. It provides an intuitive interface for managing, testing, and using MCP servers with your favorite chat plugins.

## How does MCP Hub work?

Let's break down how MCP Hub operates in simple terms:

### MCP Config File

Like any MCP client, MCP Hub requires a configuration file to define the MCP servers you want to use. This file is typically located at `~/.config/mcphub/servers.json`. MCP Hub supports local `stdio` servers as well as remote `streamable-http` or `sse` servers. This is similar to `claude_desktop_config.json` file for Claude desktop or `mcp.json` file used by VSCode. In fact you can use the same file for MCP Hub as well with some additional benefits. It looks something like:
```js
// Example: ~/.config/mcphub/servers.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-server-fetch"
      ]
    },
    "remote-server": {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Servers Manager

- When MCP Hub's `setup()` is called typically when Neovim starts, it launches the nodejs binary, [mcp-hub](https://github.com/ravitemer/mcp-hub) with the `servers.json` file.
- The `mcp-hub` binary reads `servers.json` file and starts the MCP servers.
- It provides a express REST API endpoint (default: `http://localhost:37373`) for clients to interact with MCP servers
- The plugin communicates with this endpoint to:
  - Start/stop MCP servers
  - Execute tools, resources, prompts etc
  - Handle real-time server events when tools or resources are changed.

### Usage

- Use `:MCPHub` command to open the interface
- Adding (`<A>`), editing (`<e>`), deleting (`<d>`) MCP servers in easy and intuitive with MCP Hub. You don't need to edit the `servers.json` file directly. 
- Install servers from the Marketplace (`M`)
- Toggle servers, tools, and resources etc
- Test tools and resources directly in Neovim

### Chat Integrations

- MCP Hub provides integrations with popular chat plugins like [Avante](https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim), [CodeCompanion](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim), [CopilotChat](https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim).
- LLMs can use MCP servers through our `@mcp` tool.
- Resources show up as `#variables` in chat.
- Prompts become `/slash_commands`.
