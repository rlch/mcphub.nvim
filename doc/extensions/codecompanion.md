Add MCP capabilities to [CodeCompanion.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim) by adding it as an extension. 

## Features

- Access MCP tools via the `@mcp` tool in the chat buffer.
- Utilize MCP resources as context variables using the `#` prefix (e.g., `#resource_name`).
- Execute MCP prompts directly using `/mcp:prompt_name` slash commands.
- Supports ðŸ–¼ images as shown in the demo.
- Receive real-time updates in CodeCompanion when MCP servers change.

## MCP Hub Extension

Register MCP Hub as an extension in your CodeCompanion configuration:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  extensions = {
    mcphub = {
      callback = "mcphub.extensions.codecompanion",
      opts = {
        show_result_in_chat = true,  -- Show mcp tool results in chat
        show_raw_result = false,     -- Show mcp tool results in a fenced code block
        make_vars = true,            -- Convert resources to #variables
        make_slash_commands = true,  -- Add prompts as /slash commands
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can interact with MCP Hub within the CodeCompanion chat buffer:

-   **Tool Access:** Type `@mcp` to add available MCP servers to the system prompt, enabling the LLM to use registered MCP tools.
-   **Resources as Variables:** If `make_vars = true`, MCP resources become available as variables prefixed with `#`. You can include these in your prompts (e.g., `Summarize the issues in #mcp:lsp:get_diagnostics`):

*Example: Accessing LSP diagnostics*:

**Prompts as Slash Commands:** If `make_slash_commands = true`, MCP prompts are available as slash commands (e.g., `/mcp:prompt_name`). Arguments are handled via `vim.ui.input`.

*Example: Using an MCP prompt via slash command*:

## Auto-Approval

By default, whenever codecompanion calls `use_mcp_tool` or `access_mcp_resource` tool, it shows a confirm dialog with tool name, server name and arguments.

1. You can set `auto_approve` to `true` to automatically approve MCP tool calls without user confirmation.

```lua
require("mcphub").setup({
    -- This sets vim.g.mcphub_auto_approve to true by default (can also be toggled from the HUB UI with `ga`)
    auto_approve = true, 
})
```

This also sets `vim.g.mcphub_auto_approve` variable to `true`. You can also toggle this option in the MCP Hub UI with `ga` keymap. You can see the current auto approval status in the Hub UI.

2. MCP Hub also respects CodeCompanion auto tool mode: `vim.g.codecompanion_auto_tool_mode = true` (toggled via `gta` in the chat buffer)
